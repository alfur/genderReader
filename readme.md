Content
-------

The subdirectory `gender.c` contains the entire original application and documentation files. Only `nam_dict.txt` is actually used by genderReader.

This directory contains the PHP script used to generate lists from the prename dictionary. Settings required to read from the dictionary are stored within `genderReaderConfiguration.php`. The reader itself is in `genderReader.php`.

You can find some sample scripts in the `samples` directory.
